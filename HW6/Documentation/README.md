## Challenge 1: Project Proposal

[Cat Tracker: Project Proposal](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xfuLxy2PaP_ie7QjM4WHKkoSBVSgxtEl-8eqzutL6aY/edit?usp=share_link)

In our initial project proposal, we first went over our customer's general needs, which were to track whenever their roommate's cat entered or exited the room. The sensor also should not emit any auditory cues. After that, we conducted a potential customer survey asking for what additional features would be acceptable or appropriate and conducted background research at the same time.

After gathering all the potential customer feedback and doing the background research, we came to the conclusion that our device should contain a display showing when the cat is in the room or not, have a collar with a name tag come complementary with the sensor, and have the sensor be connected to a phone app to receive signals.

Our initial plan for our prototype was to consist of 2 parts: an emitter that sends out signals, this will be attached to the cat's collar, and a receiver that detects the signals and relays them to the phone, this will be placed on a wall that is close to the door to the room. The receiver more specifically will contain 2 adjacent infrared sensors, one closer to the door and the other slightly further away. The order in which they are triggered will determine if the cat entered the room or exited the room.
